# 🧱 Blockchain Basics & Concepts

## 📌 Blockchain Definition
A **blockchain** is a decentralized and tamper-proof digital ledger 
that records transactions in a series of connected blocks. Each block 
contains transaction data, a timestamp, its own hash, and the hash of 
the previous block, forming a secure and chronological chain. This 
structure ensures that once data is written to a block, it cannot be 
altered without affecting all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus 
from the network. By removing the need for a central authority, blockchain 
enhances transparency, trust, and security across various applications. 
It is most commonly known as the foundation of cryptocurrencies but is 
also used in many other domains.

## 🌍 Real-Life Use Cases of Blockchain

**1. Supply Chain Management**  
Blockchain improves traceability of products across the supply chain, 
helping to verify authenticity, reduce fraud, and increase efficiency.

**2. Digital Identity**  
Blockchain allows individuals to securely store and control their 
identity data, reducing the risk of identity theft and simplifying 
verification processes.
